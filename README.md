# Movie-Recommendation-Model

## Introduction
In today’s digital world, users are overwhelmed with the abundance of movie choices available across various platforms. As a result, deciding what to watch next has become increasingly difficult. Movie Recommendation Systems offer a practical solution to this issue by helping users discover movies tailored to their preferences, based on data and intelligent algorithms.

This project aims to build a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests similar movies to a given title using various metadata features such as genre, overview, cast, crew, and keywords. The recommendations are based on the similarity between movies, allowing the system to offer personalized suggestions without the need for explicit user ratings or interaction history.
